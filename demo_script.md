# Sales Copilot Demo Script

**Scenario**: A financial advisor (John Smith) is calling a potential client (Karen Smith) to discuss investment opportunities.

**Trigger Word**: "Let me check"

---

**Agent (John Smith)**: Hello, am I speaking with Karen Smith?

**Lead (Karen Smith)**: Yes, this is Karen. Who is this?

**Agent**: Hi Karen, this is John Smith from Dash Consulting. I hope you're having a good day. I'm calling to follow up on your interest in our new high-yield savings plans.

**Lead**: Oh, right. I remember looking at that. But honestly, I'm a bit worried about the market volatility right now. Is my money actually safe?

**Agent**: That's a completely valid concern, Karen. The market has been fluctuating. However, our plans are principal-protected, meaning your initial investment is secure regardless of market dips.

**Lead**: I see. And what about liquidity? If I need the money for an emergency, can I withdraw it immediately?

**Agent**: That is a great question. **Let me check** the specific terms for the liquidity options on this plan.

*(System triggers RAG here. Expected Answer: "Yes, partial withdrawals are allowed after 3 months with a small fee, or full withdrawal after 1 year.")*

**Agent**: Okay, so for this specific plan, you can make partial withdrawals after 3 months with a nominal fee, and full penalty-free withdrawals are available after 1 year.

**Lead**: Okay, that sounds reasonable. What kind of returns are we looking at?

**Agent**: We are currently seeing an annualized return of approximately 8-10%, which is significantly higher than traditional savings accounts.

**Lead**: Interesting. Send me the details by email, I'll take a look.

**Agent**: I will send that right over. Thank you for your time, Karen. Have a great day!

**Lead**: You too, bye.
